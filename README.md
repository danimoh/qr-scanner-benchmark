## Qr library comparison

This repository compares performance of the qr scanner libraries github.com/zxing-js/library, github.com/cozmo/jsQR and github.com/LazarSoft/jsqrcode (even with some improvements).

The test suite is forked from the zxing library.

The results are contained in `result.txt`.
